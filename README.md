AutoHotKey scripts to simulate Pop!OS shortcuts on Windows


The goal of this project is to add a simple way to simulate the shortcuts available by default on
[Pop! OS](https://pop.system76.com/), this is not a complete port of the shortcuts and features from
the GNOME config on the distro, a tiling windows manager will not be provided on this project,
however some similar feeling can be achieved using FancyZones from
[PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) or an alternative tiling manager for Windows.
